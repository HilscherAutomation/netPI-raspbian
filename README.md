## Raspbian

Made for Raspberry Pi 3B architecture based devices and compatibles

### Docker repository

https://hub.docker.com/r/hilschernetpi/netpi-raspbian/

### Container features 

The image provided hereunder deploys a Debian based container with SSH server, pre-compiled software/packages found installed on Raspbian OS (inclusive userland tools) and a default user which is `pi`.

Base of this image builds [debian](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/base-images/base-images/) with enabled [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), installed [userland](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland) tools, created user 'pi' and preinstalled packages of a Raspbian lite operating system (headless).

### Container hosts

The container has been successfully tested on the following hosts

* netPI, model RTE 3, product name NIOT-E-NPI3-51-EN-RE
* netPI, model CORE 3, product name NIOT-E-NPI3-EN
* netFIELD Connect, product name NIOT-E-TPI51-EN-RE/NFLD
* Raspberry Pi, model 3B
* Raspberry Pi, model 4B (arm32v7,arm64v8)

netPI devices specifically feature a restricted Docker protecting the Docker host system software's integrity by maximum. The restrictions are

* privileged mode is not automatically adding all host devices `/dev/` to a container
* volume bind mounts to rootfs is not supported
* the devices `/dev`,`/dev/mem`,`/dev/sd*`,`/dev/dm*`,`/dev/mapper`,`/dev/mmcblk*` cannot be added to a container

### Container setup

#### Environment variable (optional)

The container binds the SSH server port to `22` by default.

For an alternative port use the variable **SSHPORT** with the desired port number as value.

#### Network mode

The container supports the bridged or host network mode. More details at [Container networking](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/).

##### Bridged

Any unused Docker host port needs to be mapped to the default container port `22` or the one set by **SSHPORT** to expose the container SSH server to the Docker host. 

Remark: Container bluetooth functionality is supported in host network mode only.

##### Host

Port mapping is unnecessary since all the used container ports (like `22` or **SSHPORT**) are exposed to the host automatically.

Remark: Host network mode is mandatory for using container bluetooth functions.

#### Hostname (optional)

For an equal default Raspbian OS hostname set the container hostname to `raspberrypi`.

#### Privileged mode (optional)

The privileged mode lifts the standard Docker enforced container limitations: applications inside a container are getting (almost) all capabilities as if running on the host directly.

Enabling the privileged mode is optional but mandatory for the following container functions:

* bluetooth
* userland tools

#### Host devices (optional)

For bluetooth functionality the `/dev/ttyAMA0` Docker host device needs to be added to the container. In conjunction the `/dev/vcio` Docker host device needs be added to the container as well to allow bluetooth controller resets. 

For using userland tools like [vcmailbox](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/blob/master/host_applications/linux/apps/vcmailbox/vcmailbox.c) the `/dev/vcio` and `/dev/vchiq` and `/dev/vc-mem` Docker host devices need to be added to the container.

### Container deployment

Pulling the image may take 10 minutes.

#### netPI example

STEP 1. Open netPI's web UI in your browser (https).

STEP 2. Click the Docker tile to open the [Portainer.io](http://portainer.io/) Docker management user interface.

STEP 3. Enter the following parameters under *Containers > + Add Container*

Parameter | Value | Remark
:---------|:------ |:------
*Image* | **hilschernetpi/netpi-raspbian** | a :tag may be added as well
*Network > Network* | **bridge** or **host** | use either or
*Network > Hostname* | **raspberrypi** | optional
*Restart policy* | **always**
*Adv.con.set. > Env > +add env.var.* | *name* **SSHPORT** -> *value* **any number value** | optional for different SSH port
*Port mapping* | *host* **unused port** -> *container* **22** / **SSHPORT** | in bridged mode only
*Adv.con.set. > Devices > +add device* | *Host path* **/dev/ttyAMA0** -> *Container path* **/dev/ttyAMA0** | optional for bluetooth
*Adv.con.set. > Devices > +add device* | *Host path* **/dev/vcio** -> *Container path* **/dev/vcio** | optional for bluetooth, userland tools
*Adv.con.set. > Devices > +add device* | *Host path* **/dev/vchiq** -> *Container path* **/dev/vchiq** | optional for userland tools
*Adv.con.set. > Devices > +add device* | *Host path* **/dev/vc-mem** -> *Container path* **/dev/vc-mem** | optional for userland tools
*Adv.con.set. > Privileged mode* | **On** | optional for bluetooth, userland tools

STEP 4. Press the button *Actions > Start/Deploy container*

#### Docker command line example

`docker run -d --privileged --network=host --restart=always -e SSHPORT=22 --device=/dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyAMA0 --device=/dev/vcio:/dev/vcio --device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq --device=/dev/vc-mem:/dev/vc-mem -p 22:22/tcp hilschernetpi/netpi-raspbian`

#### Docker compose example

A `docker-compose.yml` file could look like this

    version: "2"

    services:
     nodered:
       image: hilschernetpi/netpi-raspbian
       restart: always
       privileged: true
       network_mode: host
       ports:
         - 22:22
       devices:
         - "/dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyAMA0"
         - "/dev/vcio:/dev/vcio"
         - "/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq"
         - "/dev/vc-mem:/dev/vc-mem"
       environment:
         - SSHPORT=22

### Container access

The container starts the SSH server automatically when deployed. 

For an SSH terminal session use an SSH client such as [putty](http://www.putty.org/) with the Docker host IP address (@port number `22` or **SSHPORT** or bridge mode mapped one).

Use the credentials `pi` as user and `raspberry` as password when asked and you are logged in as non-root user `pi`.

Continue to use [Linux commands](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/commands.md) in the terminal as usual.
